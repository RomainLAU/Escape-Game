# Google Escape-Game

Welcome to our computer-themed Escape Game.

In this escape game, you will play the role of an industrial spy from Yahoo, present on the Google site in the office of Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google.
Your objective is simple, get out of this office with the compromising information on Google without wasting time, because if at the end of the timer you are still present in Google's premises, the boss will come back from his meeting with his guards who will not hesitate to shoot on you as soon as they see you.

Good luck !
